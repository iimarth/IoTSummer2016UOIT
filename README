Steps to recreate the demo:
Please download the zip-file 'template_apache-spark-demo-master.zip' and 
open the main class by navigating through the levels (project dist-data-spark --> iotprojectspark --> SparkIoT.java)
and run the SparkIoT class. The SparkIoT class that contains the main class is also using the UserInfo.java class that
can be found in the same package. 
To demonstrate how the program could be visualized, please refer after running the main class 
to the link http://localhost:8080/heatmap.html. 
The code can be found in the zip-file 'dist-data-processing-starter-project-master.zip'.
